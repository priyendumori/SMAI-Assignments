# Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are much simpler than Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and rely on strong assumptions which may not always be true. However, if the assumptions are true then you may see better performance from an HMM since it is less finicky to get working. On the other hand, even if the assumptions roughly hold true, if you have gobs of data than an RNN may still perform better since the extra complexity can take better advantage of the information in your data.
